From Skills to Bills: What a 1% Gap Can Really Cost You 💰

In manufacturing and distribution, small gaps create big leaks.  
One missing skill. One unclear instruction. One assumption.

It’s not always obvious.  
But over time, it shows up in:

- Delayed orders  
- Low morale  
- Rework and scrap  
- Customer complaints  
- High turnover  
- And yes… in your financials.

📉 The 1% That Costs You Thousands  
You may not see it daily, but it's there:

- A new hire doesn’t know how to report a defect  
- A supervisor avoids conflict instead of correcting behavior  
- A team misreads a client’s technical spec  
- HR keeps filling roles without fixing capability gaps  

It’s death by a thousand paper cuts.  
Even a 1% drop in skill across departments can quietly cost $50,000 to $100,000 per quarter — sometimes more.

🧠 Why This Happens  
Because most companies:

- Focus on tools and tech — not people  
- Promote supervisors without proper leadership training  
- Assume experience = skill  
- Measure output, but not performance gaps  
- And nobody owns the real cause: undetected skill gaps.

⚠ If You’re Seeing This…  
- High turnover in production or support roles  
- “We told them, but they still don’t do it”  
- Constant retraining with no improvement  
- HR and Ops not aligned  
- Blame instead of data  

It’s time to pause and look deeper.  
This isn’t a training issue. It’s a business leak.
