### **The Funnel: From Lead Magnet → Paying Client**  
*(How the template pre-qualifies leads & sets the stage)*  

1. **Lead Downloads Template**  
   → *They self-identify a critical gap (e.g., "MTTR skyrocketing," "Bilingual feedback breakdowns")*  
   → *They see your client’s framework ("Four Circles," neuroscience triggers)*  
   → **Their Mindset:** *"She diagnosed my pain – now I need her solution."*  

2. **Lead Books Call**  
   → *They arrive with SPECIFIC pain points (thanks to the template)*  
   → *Your client controls the conversation using their self-reported gaps*

### **Use Case 1: The Plant Manager Fighting Downtime**  
*(Template Gap Identified: "High MTTR + Low Troubleshooting Skills")*  

**Your Client’s Discovery Call Script:**  
> *"I see you flagged MTTR and troubleshooting gaps on your Skills Heat Map. Tell me:  
> **‘When a machine goes down, what’s the #1 thing that drags out repair time?**  
> \- Is it techs guessing instead of diagnosing?  
> \- Or supervisors not coaching in the moment?"*  

**Lead’s Likely Answer:**  
> *"Both! Our techs patch things but don’t fix root causes, and supervisors just escalate instead of teaching."*  

**Your Client’s Pitch:**  
> *"That’s exactly what our **‘Supervisor to Super Leader’ program** fixes. We train your leads in real-time gemba coaching – so they stop firefighting and start upskilling techs on the spot.  
> **Result:** Cut MTTR by 40% in 6 weeks. Here’s how..."*

*(Template Gap Identified: "Low Psychological Safety + Relational Intelligence Gaps")*  

**Your Client’s Discovery Call Script:**  
> *"Your Heat Map showed relational intelligence as a Quadrant 1 gap. Be honest:  
> **‘When mistakes happen, do people hide them or solve them?**  
> \- How many near-misses went unreported last month?"*  

**Lead’s Likely Answer:**  
> *"People are scared to speak up – especially on night shift. We only hear about issues when they blow up."*  

**Your Client’s Pitch:**  
> *"Our **neuroscience-backed safety program** builds psychological safety from the ground up. We teach bilingual teams to give feedback without fear using our ‘Four Circles’ method.  
> **Result:** 55% more near-miss reports + 30% faster problem-solving. Imagine the cost savings..."*  
> *(Shares ROI: "Food plant avoided $2M recall by catching a near-miss")*

*(Template Gap Identified: "Low AI Literacy Among Leaders")*  

**Your Client’s Discovery Call Script:**  
> *"You rated ‘AI alert evaluation’ as a high-proficiency gap. Quick test:  
> **‘When your predictive maintenance system flags an anomaly, what happens?**  
> \- Do leads trust it? Or ignore it as ‘tech noise’?"*  

**Lead’s Likely Answer:**  
> *"They mostly ignore it... until the machine fails. Then it’s chaos."*  

**Your Client’s Pitch:**  
> *"Our **AI Integration Labs** train leaders to translate AI alerts into actions – in English, Spanish, or French. No more guessing.  
> **Result:** 92% faster response to warnings + 18% longer machine life. Here’s the data..."*  
> *(Shows dashboard: "Client reduced unplanned downtime by 210 hours/year")*
