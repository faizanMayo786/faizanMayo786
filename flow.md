Here’s a **flow diagram**

**🔄 End-to-End Automation Flow**

1. **Content & Scheduling**
   - Draft “Espen-style” LinkedIn post
   - Schedule & publish via Meet Alfred (or Dripify)

2. **Engagement Trigger**
   - Prospect comments the magic word (“o4”)
   - Alfred detects the comment

3. **Auto-DM Delivery**
   - Alfred (or your custom script) sends a personalized DM with the Notion link
   - Prospect record created in Google Sheet/CRM with status “Contacted”

4. **Lead Enrichment**
   - Zapier/Make picks up new sheet rows → calls Snov.io/SalesQL API
   - Populates email, company, role back into the sheet/CRM; marks “Enriched”

5. **Email Warm-Up & Outreach**
   - Enriched emails enter Instantly domain-warmup
   - After 3–5 days → pushed to Smartlead/Lemlist sequence:
      - *Email 1:* Prompt stack
      - *Email 2:* Case study
      - *Email 3:* Call-to-action + Calendly link

6. **Intent-Based Handoff**
   - CRM flags “Hot” when:
   – ≥2 email link clicks **OR**
   – Reply to DM/email
   - Zapier notifies you (Slack/email) to book a 1:1 call

7. **Reporting & Optimization**
   - Google Data Studio dashboard (connected to sheet/CRM)
   - Weekly review of: post reach, comment volume, DM/open rates, email metrics, booked calls
   - Iterate post copy, sequence timing, and tool settings
