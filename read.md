Hereâ€™s a straightforward explanation of what each of the three Python scripts does, with a more detailed breakdown of their expected outputs based on example inputs:

---

### 1. Email Formatter App
- **What It Does**: A GUI app (`customtkinter`) that takes an Excel file, splits comma-separated emails in a user-specified column into separate rows, skips rows with "ignored values" (e.g., "No valid emails found"), and saves the result to a new Excel file. Users can manage ignored values via a settings interface (`settings.json`).
- **Behavior**: Opens a 400x600 window with input/output file selection, "Process" and "Settings" buttons, and a log area. User selects files, chooses a column, and processes the data.
- **Detailed Output**:
  - **Input Example** (`input.xlsx`):
    ```
    | Name  | Emails                  |
    |-------|-------------------------|
    | Alice | alice@example.com       |
    | Bob   | bob@example.com, bob2@example.com |
    | Carol | No valid emails found   |
    | Dave  | dave@example.com, ,dave2@example.com |
    ```
  - **Process**: User selects `input.xlsx`, sets output as `output.xlsx`, chooses "Emails" column, and clicks "Process".
  - **Output Example** (`output.xlsx`):
    ```
    | Name  | Emails            |
    |-------|-------------------|
    | Alice | alice@example.com |
    | Bob   | bob@example.com   |
    | Bob   | bob2@example.com  |
    | Dave  | dave@example.com  |
    | Dave  | dave2@example.com |
    ```
    - **Details**: 
      - "Alice" stays as one row (single email).
      - "Bob" splits into two rows (comma-separated emails).
      - "Carol" is skipped (matches ignored value "No valid emails found").
      - "Dave" splits into two rows (empty entries ignored after splitting).
  - **Log Output**:
    ```
    2025-03-06 ... - INFO - Processing file...
    2025-03-06 ... - INFO - Formatted data has been saved to output.xlsx
    ```
  - **Errors**: Logs "Input file does not exist" or "Column not found" if applicable.

### 2. Email Adder App
- **What It Does**: A GUI app (`customtkinter`) that merges emails from a second Excel file into an original Excel file by matching values in user-selected columns (e.g., "Website"). Adds a new "Website Email" column to the original file.
- **Behavior**: Opens a 700x500 window with buttons to select two Excel files, dropdowns for column selection, and an "Add Emails" button. User picks files, columns, and saves the result.
- **Detailed Output**:
  - **Input Example**:
    - **Original File** (`original.xlsx`):
      ```
      | Website         | Other Data |
      |-----------------|------------|
      | example.com     | Data1      |
      | test.com        | Data2      |
      | missing.com     | Data3      |
      ```
    - **Second File** (`second.xlsx`):
      ```
      | Website     | Emails            |
      |-------------|-------------------|
      | example.com | user@example.com  |
      | test.com    | user@test.com     |
      ```
  - **Process**: User selects `original.xlsx` and `second.xlsx`, picks "Website" from both dropdowns, clicks "Add Emails", and saves as `output.xlsx`.
  - **Output Example** (`output.xlsx`):
    ```
    | Website         | Other Data | Website Email    |
    |-----------------|------------|------------------|
    | example.com     | Data1      | user@example.com |
    | test.com        | Data2      | user@test.com    |
    | missing.com     | Data3      | NaN              |
    ```
    - **Details**:
      - "example.com" and "test.com" get emails from `second.xlsx` based on matching "Website".
      - "missing.com" gets `NaN` (no match in `second.xlsx`).
  - **Message**: Popup shows "Success: Updated file saved at output.xlsx".
  - **Errors**: Popup for missing files ("Please select both files") or processing issues ("Failed to process files: <error>").

---

### 3. File Cleaner Script
- **What It Does**: A script (`tkinter` + `pandas`) that prompts the user to select an Excel (`.xlsx`) or CSV (`.csv`) file, removes duplicate rows based on the "Website Email" column (keeping the first occurrence), and saves the result as `cleaned_file.xlsx`.
- **Behavior**: Prints a prompt, opens a file dialog, processes the file, and outputs the result.
- **Detailed Output**:
  - **Input Example** (`input.xlsx`):
    ```
    | Website         | Website Email    | Other Data |
    |-----------------|------------------|------------|
    | example.com     | user@example.com | Data1      |
    | test.com        | user@test.com    | Data2      |
    | duplicate.com   | user@example.com | Data3      |
    | another.com     | user@test.com    | Data4      |
    ```
  - **Process**: User selects `input.xlsx` via file dialog; script processes and saves `cleaned_file.xlsx`.
  - **Output Example** (`cleaned_file.xlsx`):
    ```
    | Website         | Website Email    | Other Data |
    |-----------------|------------------|------------|
    | example.com     | user@example.com | Data1      |
    | test.com        | user@test.com    | Data2      |
    ```
    - **Details**:
      - "example.com" kept as first occurrence of `user@example.com`.
      - "test.com" kept as first occurrence of `user@test.com`.
      - "duplicate.com" removed (duplicate `user@example.com`).
      - "another.com" removed (duplicate `user@test.com`).
  - **Console Output**:
    ```
    Please select an Excel (.xlsx) or CSV (.csv) file:
    Cleaned file saved as cleaned_file.xlsx
    ```
  - **Errors**: 
    - "No file selected. Exiting." if dialog canceled.
    - "Unsupported file format..." for non-`.xlsx`/`.csv` files.
    - Crashes with `KeyError` if "Website Email" column is missing.
