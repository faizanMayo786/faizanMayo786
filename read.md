# OR Linkedin Post 2:
Employee turnover isn’t just an HR headache—it’s a $100,000+ leak in your revenue bucket. And most leaders can’t even find the hole.

After helping 87 companies plug retention leaks, we found:
- 92% know turnover costs thousands per exit
- But 0% know exactly where risks hide in THEIR teams

That’s why we built something new.

The free “Team Pulse & Retention Toolkit” — a manual version of our AI HR tech that lets you:
✅ Uncover hidden culture gaps (recognition, workload, safety) in <60 mins
✅ Auto-score retention risk with Red/Yellow/Green dashboards
✅ Spark data-driven leadership convos with plug-and-play templates

No theory. Just our battle-tested system:
1️⃣ Culture Pulse Survey (10 questions)
2️⃣ Retention Risk Calculator (Excel/Sheets)
3️⃣ Leadership Comms Templates
4️⃣ 60-Minute Action Plan

Why it works:
> “Used this yesterday—found 3 ticking time bombs HR missed for months.”
